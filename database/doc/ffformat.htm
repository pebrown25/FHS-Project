<HR>
The purpose of this section is to satisfy the curiosity of the 2-3% of
the users of the Family History System that want a more detailed
description of the contents of the 3 datasets that comprise a family
file.  If the following discussion makes little sense to you, you are
really none the worse for it.<P>

First I should remind you that a family file is really composed of
three datasets (or collections of records of information) that are
interconnected by a system of program maintained "pointer" fields.
Each of the datasets is a standard BASIC random access file.
Therefore all of the records in each dataset are of the same length
and each record can be directly accessed by its record number without
having to read the records preceding it in the file.  The three
datasets that make up a family file are:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>NAME dataset, e.g. FAMILY.NAM, with 100 character records
<LI>ADDRESS dataset, e.g. FAMILY.ADR, with 108 or 152 character
records (depending on whether "short" or "long" address records are being used)
<LI>and MISCELLANEOUS Info dataset, e.g. FAMILY.OTH, with 50 character
records.
</UL>
Each record in these datasets is further "logically" divided into a
number of fixed position "fields" of information.  The placement and
purpose of each of these fields will be described below.  In that
description, each field will be assigned a "DATA TYPE" by a 2
character alphabetic symbol as follows:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>AC - ASCII Character - used for Text fields such as names and
places; variable in length
<LI>SI - Single Precision Integer - numeric field which can assume
any value between (approximately) -32000 and +32000;
each field is 2 characters long;
<LI>BM - Bit mapped flag or status field; 1 character long.
</UL>

As mentioned previously, POINTER FIELDS are used to logically connect
two separate records in a family file.  These fields are defined as
single precision integers which has the effect of limiting the number
of records in each of the family datasets to 32000.  (Prior to January
1993 the name file was effectively limited to 9999 records because the
onscreen data areas and the report fields for ID numbers allowed only
4 digits).<P>

Each Family History System dataset has a "HEADER Record" (the first
record in the dataset) whose first character identifies the type
dataset it is.  The header record has other fields which are used to
store information needed by the system to process the dataset.  Among
these fields are 3 that indicate the date and time that the associated
NAME dataset was CREATED.  Using this DATE/TIME "Stamp" the programs
can determine whether the family file datasets "go together" or
"match".  Each "work" file header record also contains the DATE/TIME
identifying fields for the family file used to create the work file so
that the programs will know whether a work file matches a particular
family file.  Note that the system can not distinguish (using the
DATE/TIME fields) between family files which are copies of one another
or which were created within the same minute of the same day.  
Therefore if you are creating several separate family files, you shouldn't
initialize them all at the same time (or within a minute of each other
anyway).  You should also notice that the programs do not use the
external name of the datasets to determine whether they go together.
You may freely rename the datasets using the DOS RENAME command without 
affecting the way the system will handle them.<P>

One more remark concerning POINTER Field values...the actual file
record number of the record pointed to is found by adding 1 to the
pointer field value.  For example a pointer field which refers to the
first NAME record will have a value of 1, although that NAME record is
actually the 2nd record in the dataset because of the HEADER record
at the beginning of the dataset.<P>

Before presenting the record descriptions I should make one more
comment concerning the stored formats for DATEs and TIMEs.  The system
stores all dates in two SI fields:  One containing the value of the
YEAR (YYYY) and a second which has the month and day combined
according to the formula MM*100+DD.  Similarly, a TIME (HH:MM) is
stored in a single SI field using the formula HH*100+MM.  (Better
formulae would of course be: MM*256+DD and HH*256+MM, but I didn't
think of that until after I had sent out the first version of the
programs back in 1985.)<P>

The record descriptions will be presented for each of the family file
datasets in tables which have the following (unlabeled) columns:
<UL>
<LI>OFST - the offset into the record of the beginning of the field;
(the number of bytes preceding the field in the record);
<LI>TYPE - the 2 character DATA TYPE designation described previously;
bit mapped fields will be followed by one or more descriptions of the 
meanings of individual bits in the field;
<LI>NAME - a short name describing the field
<LI>DESC - a description of the field contents or its purpose.
