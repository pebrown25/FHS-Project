Family History System
with Extensions

by Phillip E. Brown

A set of programs for maintaining files of personal data, including FAMILY relationships.

I want to thank you for your interest in the “Family History System” (FHS) for organizing and reporting the results
of your research into your own family history. Although I first began work on these programs in 1985 for the purpose
of “computerizing” the information in a family booklet prepared by a distant cousin, I have been pleased to find that
this software has proven useful to so many others with similar interests, over three decades.

The basic system produces Ancestor, Descendant, Relative and Family Group reports, Ancestor (tree) Charts and a variety
of “BOX” style charts. Blank worksheets and charts may be produced to record information for entry into the system. You
may also print a variety of summary reports and detail lists of information from selected records. The "extended" system
adds the ability to process records in sorted sequence.

The original FHS software has always been written in some form of Basic, from the original interpretive language
BASIC A, through GW-BASIC, QuickBasic, and Microsoft Professional Basic (aka MSBasic).  The final version of that
text-based program is labeled the "1997" version, but was actually maintained through 2001.
